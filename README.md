# Win10PersistSpotlight
The Windows 10 lock/login screen showcases 'spotlight images'.  The images are stored in a special folder that Windows cleans up periodically. 

This Groovy script copies those images to `<home>/Pictures/SpotlightImages` for long term keeping (ie: to use as a desktop background)

## How To Run
Install [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/ "Groovy"), and then run `groovy main`
